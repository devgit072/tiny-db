A relational DB implementation just like MySQL clone which executes normal SQL query. It supports most of SQL queries and list of all queries which has been tested are present in the file: `src/test/java/com/devrajs/tinydb/QueryExecutorTest.java`  
It also supports ACID transactions, ERD diagram generation and taking dump and restoring from it. I just created it for my learning purpose.
